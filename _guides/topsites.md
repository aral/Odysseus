You open [new tabs](odysseus:home) to go somewhere, so Odysseus provides links to pages it thinks you're most likely to go to. Specifically it links to:

* Pages you've explicitly indicated you want to be "pinned" there. You can drag these to rearrange them, and they are color coded with a blue shadow.
* Your most frequently visited pages (visited at most 20 times) from most frequent & recent to least. These are color coded gray.
* A [curated list](/Odysseus-recommendations/) of nonsponsored links you haven't visited yet randomly fills in the remainder of the homepage slots. These are color coded green.

These links are kept in a 5x4 grid that explicitly excludes links you told it to (by clicking the `x` button on one of these links) or have failed to be screenshotted.

Links can be "pinned" to this page by dragging and dropping them within the grid or by clicking the `✓` button.
